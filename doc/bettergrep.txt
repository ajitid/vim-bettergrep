INTRODUCTION                                                      *bettergrep*

This plugin uses ideas from RomainL's gist
(https://gist.github.com/romainl/56f0c28ef953ffc157f36cc495947ab3)
about improving how Vim does grep. If you are using NeoVim, this will also
grep asynchronously. The intended use is as a replacement to Vim's built-in
|:grep| family of functions. This plugin by default replaces the default
command-line mode commands with the custom-made ones from this plugin.

:Grep [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                *:Grep*

    Search recursively in {directory} (defaults to current directory) for
    {pattern}. You may uses [options] corresponding to the grep program set by
    |g:bettergrepprg|. It will populate the |quickfix| window with the
    results. If your pattern contains a space consider enclosing it in single
    quotes ('). Typing |:grep| in |command-line mode| will replace it with
    |:Grep|. To turn off this behavior, see |g:bettergrep_no_abbrev|.

    bettergrep runs the command in shell. If you want to search a pattern with
    a space try enclosing the pattern with a single-quote. >
        :Grep 'my pattern' path/to/file
<
    see: |:grep|

:LGrep [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                              *:LGrep*

    Like |:Grep| but populates the |location-list| instead.

    see: |:lgrep|

:Grepadd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:Grepadd*

    Like |:Grep| but adds to the |quickfix| window without removing what's
    there.

    see: |:grepadd|

:LGrepadd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]

    Like |:Grepadd| but with the |location-list| window instead.

    see: |:lgrepadd|

MAPPINGS                                                 *bettergrep-mappings*

                                                           *bettergrep-CTRL-G*
CTRL-G          Insert |:Grep| into command-line mode and start cursor after
                it.

                                                            *bettergrep-ALT-G*
ALT-G           Insert |:Grepadd| into the command-line mode and start cursor
                after it.
==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                       *bettergrep-configuration*

g:bettergrepprg                                              *g:bettergrepprg*

    Defaults to (in order):
        - ripgrep             ("rg --vimgrep")
        - The Silver Searcher ("ag --vimgrep")
        - ack             ("ack -s -H --nopager --nocolor --nogroup --column")
        - |'grepprg'|
    
    Set this to whatever you would like to grep with.
    Example: >
        let g:bettergrpprg = "git grep -n"
<

g:bettergrep_no_abbrev                                *g:bettergrep_no_abbrev*

    Default: 0

    Set this to 1 if you don't want your command-line rewritten for legacy
    |:grep| commands.
    Example: >
        let g:bettergrep_no_abbrev = 1
<
g:bettergrep_no_mappings                            *g:bettergrep_no_mappings*

    Default: 0

    Set this to 1 if you don't want the default |CTRL-G| to map to |:Grep|
    Example: >
        let g:bettergrep_no_mappings = 1
<
    see: |bettergrep-CTRL-G|
